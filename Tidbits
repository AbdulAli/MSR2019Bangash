Stack overflow itself gives just three categories of machine learning tags but fe further digged down.

Our tagging tachnique will help novice users reach experts of that domain e.g. algorithms tags are more frequesntly answered by professors. If a person writes a question about ML and adds the tag of ML only, the algorithm tag wont appear.


Our technique will help increase users visibility to the right community. This way users will also get less negative feedback.

Explain topics which are confusing.

Threats to validity:
To avoid biasness we did not add tags information while training LDA
It should be noted that our technique finds topic on the basis of whole post not just question.


Accuracy of our topics for 230 random posts is 66.5 %
If we remove some outliers like ethnicity,tensorflow,sentiment analysis and caret
our accuracy for suggesting tags becomes 72%.

Further we find out that out of the 151 correctly identified topics in 230 posts, there are 86 such posts on Stackoverflow who don't have this tag.
This means that out of 230 posts around 60% posts need our correctly identified topics as tags.
